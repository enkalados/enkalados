<h2>Unity Game Developer </h2>
  
I've been working on Unity partially since 2018, more focused since the beginning of 2020. I love games so much that I tried to make games in high school without knowing coding. Then I made that my goal. Thanks to the "Kodluyoruz Mobil Game Bootcamp", I learned Hypercasual games better and continued by paying attention to continuous improvement. I am trying to take part in better games in the future. I have intermediate C# and Unity skills.
